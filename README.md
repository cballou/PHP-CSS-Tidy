## About ##
php-css-tidy is a Komodo IDE macro and accompanying PHP executable bash script for compressing your CSS files. It merely compresses files and does not make attempts to optimize as does CSSTidy, as CSSTidy has shortcomings with CSS3 and vendor prefixes.

## Installation ##
Installation instructions will be available online soon!
